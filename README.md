# fake news extension

Chrome extension for detecting fake news

this is a Chrome extension which is using [this flask API](https://gitlab.com/ad_6398/fake-news-api-v1), taking a headline and body of a news as
input and return following:

        Agree: if both headline and body are in agreement with each other.

        Disagree: if both headline and body are contradicting each other.

        DIscuss: if body is neither in favor or against headline but related to each other.

        Unrelated: if both are not related to each other.
